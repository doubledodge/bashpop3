This script is based on a stack overflow post at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5911032/whats-the-best-method-for-retrieving-sender-subject-from-a-pop3-acct-via-the-c by Seth Robertson.  The script in the stack overflow post just listed a brief summary of the email headers then exited.  I have extended that script so I can list the full header or a sizeable chunk of the body of selected emails on the server and further extended it to allow the user to selectively delete mal from the server without having to download messages first.  Deleting email from the server is quite handy if you are suffering with a lot of spam or someone sends you a monster attachment that you really don't want to download.  

**WARNING:** As with all POP3 server access bear in mind that your POP3 password is transmitted in plain text therefore avoid using it when connected to a public wifi access point.

In order to use this script on //your// POP3 server you first need to add your emal address and POP3 server names to the USER= and HOST= line near the top of the script.  For security you are prompted for your password each time you run the script to avoid this being visible to anyone listing the script later.  You can even add the -s switch on the read command on line 8 if you don't wish your password to be echoed to the console.

If you wish to extend or improve the script then first read the [[Script Functional Description]] here.  Then download the bash file from
https://github.com/doubledodge/bashpop3

One improvements I would like to see is the ability to filter out all the html formatting from an email, just leaving the unadorned text and links when I list the email body.  I would be very pleased to accept any well written and tested git commits that add this feature. 

This documentation has been written using ZIM http://www.zim-wiki.org  and  convereted to html readable format from within ZIM.  The ZIM notebook is stored on this GIT project so is available for modification and updating so edit this with ZIM rather than modify the HTML it has produced.
